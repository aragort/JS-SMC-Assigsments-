    //1.-What does line 2 do?
    // Initialize an array using an array literal, and assigns 5 elements.
    colors = ["red", "blue", "yellow", "violet", "green"];



    //2.-What is line 5 output?
    // The output is red, the value of the element in index 0.
    console.log(colors[0]);



    //3.-What is line 8 output?
    //The output is yellow, the value of the element in index 2.
    console.log(colors[2]);


    //4.-Explain the next two lines.
    // Assigns ultraviolet, a new element, to index 4.
    // Prints the value of the Array colors in the console.
    colors[4] = "ultraviolet";
    console.log(colors)



    //5.-Explain the next three lines.
    //Declared the variable fourthColor, sets its value to a string, "violet".
    //Assigns fourthColor to index 3 of the Array.
    //Displays the value of the Array to the console. Value is the same because the variable store a string with the same color's name.

    fourthColor = "violet";
    colors[3] = fourthColor;
    console.log(colors);



    //.6-Explain te below two lines.
    //Adds pink as a Sixth element to the Array, index number 5.
    //Displays colors to the console.

    colors[5] = ("pink");
    console.log(colors);



    //7.-What is .unshift()
    //It's a method that adds a new element to the front of the Array and returns its value.
    //The value of colors[0] is now "White";
    colors.unshift("white");
    console.log(colors);



    //8.-What is .length property?
    //.length it's a property of Arrays that returns the number of its elements.
    //In this case, the length of colors is 7.
    console.log(colors.length);





    //9.-What does pop() do?
    //This method removes the last element of the array, and returns that element.
    //Removed pink.
    colors.pop();
    console.log(colors.length)
    console.log(colors);


    //10.-Explain the below two for loops

    //This for loop iterate over the the Array until the value of i is not less than the length of colors.
    //For every iteration, the value of i is increased, the block is executed printing the element stored in each index of the Array.
    for (var i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) {

        console.log(colors[i]);

    }


    //This loop also iterate over the Array colors.
    //Every execution prints the concatenation of the index number of each element, plus a string (colon), and the value of the element itself.
    for (var i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) {

        console.log(i + ": " + colors[i]);

    }




    //11.- What is line 48 output?
    //len, stored the number of the last index of colors (1 counting from right to left) 5.
    //lastColor, stored the element of colors which index is the value assigned to len.
    //Output is ultraviolet, value of index 5.

    var len = colors.length - 1;

    var lastColor = colors[len];

    console.log(lastColor)
